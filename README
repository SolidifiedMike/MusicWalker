## Inspiration

The project, Music Walker, is inspired by Chrome Music Lab and many research papers on how crowdsourcing can empower creative work.

## What it does

Music Walker is a web app that allows you to create music with friends by moving your avatar to step on blocks with notes defined by you. We also offer different choices of musical instruments and a few cool beats. We expect a few people to work together on one single song to maximize the fun!

## How we built it

We used React for our frontend, with a music library called Tone.js. We utilized Material UI for an aesthetic yet convenient-to-build UI. We used the sound effect provided in the Tone.js library to achieve a music playing experience. For the backend, we implemented it with Node.js, with data saved in MongoDB.

## Challenges we ran into

We found the design of the product itself to be challenging. We spent a long time deciding what this project should be like. For example, should we have monophonic synthesizers or polyphonic ones? The avatar animation is also challenging. We want it to be walking naturally while fitting perfectly into the music-creating experience. Lastly, we found the Tone.js library we are using to be hard to comprehend sometimes. We spent some time figuring out how to make it polyphonic and performant without lagging.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

The game is actually fun to play and does attract some of our friends. We believe it can be potentially popular in the future.

## What we learned

How to use Tone.js library in a React web app. Teamwork.

## What's next for MusicWalker

We are planning to launch it publically in early March. We also want to add real-time collaboration.
